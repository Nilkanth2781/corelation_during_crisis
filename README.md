# 📊 Project 2: Correlations & CAPM Betas in Market Crises

## Overview

This project was completed as part of **FINA 6333 – Data Analytics in Finance (Spring 2024)**. The goal was to test the widely-cited claim that *“correlations go to one during crises”* and to investigate whether **CAPM betas** show similar behavior.

We use **daily return data for S\&P 500 constituents (1980–2023)** and study asset co-movements during periods defined as **bear markets (≥20% decline)** and **bull market recoveries (≥20% rise)**.

## 🔑 Key Questions

* Do correlations across S\&P 500 stocks increase during crises?
* Do CAPM betas exhibit similar crisis clustering?
* How do results vary across daily, monthly, and quarterly horizons?
* What are the limitations of these measures?

### Data

* **Universe**: Current S\&P 500 stocks (1980–2023)
* **Index**: S\&P 500 (^GSPC) daily closes from 1927–2023
* **Source**: Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)

### Steps

1. **Crisis Identification**

   * Bear Market = 20% drawdown from peak
   * Bull Market = 20% recovery from trough
   * Also consider **continuous measures** (drawdowns, runups).

2. **Metrics Computed**

   * **Correlations** across asset returns (rolling windows).
   * **CAPM betas** estimated against the S\&P 500.
   * Summary statistics (mean, median, distribution).

3. **Statistical Analysis**

   * Comparison of correlations in normal vs. crisis periods.
   * Beta clustering during downturns.
   * Visualizations for clarity (heatmaps, time series, histograms).

## 📊 Results (Summary)

* **Correlations** rise sharply during crises, consistent with the saying that *“correlations go to one.”*
* **Betas** also show clustering effects, though less uniformly than correlations.
* The effect is **time-horizon dependent**: more pronounced at daily frequency than at monthly/quarterly.
* **Limitations** include survivorship bias (current S\&P 500 only), model assumptions, and potential noise in beta estimation.
